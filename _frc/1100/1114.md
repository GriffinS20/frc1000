## History

### The 2003 FRC Season

The seed for NiagaraFIRST.org was planted in October 2002\. General Motors of Canada St. Catharines Ontario Engineering Director, Stephen Rourke and Governor Simcoe Secondary School Technical Director, Greg Phillips met to discuss the possibility of fielding a rookie team in the 2003 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). The enthusiastic discussion, along with generous financial and mentor support from General Motors of Canada, quickly unfolded into an exciting rookie season for FRC Team #1114 "Simbotics". The team designed and built Simbot "Sally" – competing in two successful 2003 Regional Competitions in Pittsburgh and Toronto, followed by a trip to the National Championship in Houston, Texas. Engineers from General Motors mentored the motivated and creative students from Governor Simcoe to achieve one of the most successful rookie seasons in the 2003 FRC Game "[Stack Attack](stack-attack)".

### The 2004 FRC Season

With the taste of success still lingering from the rookie season, Rourke and Phillips built on the successful foundation. Organizational development discussions were held to align the team mission, culture, and values. Organizational strategy set the stage for improved team structure. Student team leaders and sub-team leaders were established to run the team business. The mentor base was strengthened. Rourke recruited former Woburn Team [188](/frc0000/188) FIRST Robotics veterans Ian MacKenzie and [Karthik Kanagasabapathy](Karthik_Kanagasabapathy "Karthik
Kanagasabapathy") (both of whom were attending The University of Waterloo) to provide seasoned mentor experience and to pass along lessons learned from past competitions. SimSwerve (a strafing, omni-directional mobility system) was born from the creative juices of the design team. Strategy development and analysis drove Simbot "Simon" to new heights of success in the 2004 FRC Game, "FIRST Frenzy – Raising the Bar". A gold medal at the Long Island Regional, silver medals in both the Pittsburgh Regional and the Canadian Regional, and another trip the National Championship in Atlanta, Georgia are just a few of the memorable highlights from the successful sophomore season – with "Simbotics" winning more awards than any other FIRST Team that season.
